	mechanics_text = "In thermodynamics, specific heat capacity quantifies how much an \
	object's temperature changes if one adds or removes an amount of heat energy, per unit mass. \
	In simpler terms, when an object is heated (or cooled), the object's temperature will change accordingly. \
	Less intuitively, what actually happens is that heat energy is being added or removed from the object. \
	Objects made from different materials will require different amounts of heat energy to be shifted in order to reach a desired temperature.<br>\
	<br>\
	For example, water has a high specific heat capacity, at 4.181 J/(g*K). This means that to heat up a kilogram of water, \
	by 60 degrees kelvin, it would require around 250 kJ of heat energy. \
	If instead that same amount of heat energy was applied to a kilogram of copper, the temperature of it would \
	increase by roughly 649 degrees kelvin, because copper has a lower heat capacity (0.385 J/(g*K)) compared to water.<br>\
	<br>\
	Note that in real life, a material's properties, including specific heat capacity, can change when it gets hotter or colder, \
	however that is not represented in the game.<br>\
	<br>\
	The equation for specific heat is;<br>\
	c = Q / (mdT)<br>\
	Where;<br>\
	c  - Specific heat capacity.<br>\
	Q  - Energy<br>\
	m  - Mass<br>\
	dT - Change in temperature."
